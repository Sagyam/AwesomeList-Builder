abstract: We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which
  stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike
  recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep
  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT
  model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create
  state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering
  and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture
  modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It
  obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing
  tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute
  improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD
  v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and
  SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).
